The app must include the following screens based on my existing architecture:

Auth Flow: Login, Signup, Verification, ForgotPassword, and ResetPassword.

Core Features: Home, SearchPage, ProductPage, and ProductUpdate.

User Features: Profile, CompleteProfile, OrderHistoryPage, and WishlistPage.

Information: Contact, FAQ, PrivacyPolicy, and TermsConditions.

Technical Requirements:

Navigation: Use Expo Router (file-based navigation) to organize these screens.

State & API: Use axios for API calls. Ensure the services/api logic handles mobile-specific needs (like using the machine's IP address instead of 'localhost').

Components: Convert standard web tags (div, h1, p) to React Native components (View, Text, SafeAreaView).

Styling: Use NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) or StyleSheet.create for a clean, modern UI.

Storage: Use expo-secure-store for saving user authentication tokens.
